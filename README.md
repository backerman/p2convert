# p2convert

This program is a one-trick pony indented to take video shot by a Panasonic AG-HPX300P (or other device using
the P2 format) into an H.264/AAC .mkv suitable for uploading to e.g. YouTube.

It may add features but currently has many parameters hardcoded:

* no scaling
* H.264 video
* AAC audio
* downmix all audio tracks into a single mono track
